## Task 1: Falling Character Chains

Create a program using Visual Studio with a Console Application template that displays falling chains of characters in the console window. The requirements are as follows:
- Each chain has a randomly determined length.
- The first character of each chain is white, the second is light green, and the rest are dark green.
- During the falling animation, all characters change their values.
- Once a chain reaches the bottom, it disappears, and a new chain starts falling from the top.

## Task 2: Two Chains of Characters in One Column

Extend Task 1 to simultaneously display two chains of characters in one column in the console. Refer to example2.png for the expected output format.

---

## Task 4: Recursive Method Calls in Separate Threads

Using Visual Studio, create a Console Application project. Write a program where a method is called recursively, and each new method call executes in its own thread.

---

## Task 5: Study Basic Concepts and Constructs

Learn the fundamental concepts and constructs covered in the lesson, such as:
- Working with console output and colors.
- Random number generation.
- String and character manipulation.
- Recursion.
- Multithreading (if covered in Task 4).
